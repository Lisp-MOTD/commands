## Lisp Message of the Day (Common Lisp Admin Commands)

### Caveat

Note: this depends on a patch to Ironclad which has recently been
merged into the Ironclad repository but has not yet gone into a
Quicklisp release.

### Overview

This package contains algebraic data types used to send commands
from the admin tools to the server.  These commands are in a separate
package so they can be shared easily by both admin and server.
